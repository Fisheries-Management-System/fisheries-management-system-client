            Bangladesh is acknowledged as one of the riverine countries most
            suited for fisheries management opportunities. The diversity of
            aquatic species, as well as Bangladesh's favorable geographical
            location, provides significant prospects for the effective use and
            management of fisheries resources. In Bangladesh, the fishing
            industry is one of the most successful and vibrant. The nation's
            fisheries sector contributes significantly to economic growth, job
            possibilities, and foreign exchange benefits.
